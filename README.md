This is a repository about the exercises of the Reinforcement Learning.  

It includes the main Reinforcement Learning algorithms which are based on the repository from 
's teaching github [Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow).  

The difference between his and mine is the framework, I used the Pytroch instead of Tensorflow to finish the same or maybe harder work, which means I refactor and update his work. I appreciate Movran's teaching, he is my mentoring teacher in Reinforcement Learning.  


[1. Q_Learning](https://github.com/xuejieshougeji0826/Implementation-of-Morvan-Reinforcement-Learning-Teaching-in-Pytorch/tree/master/Q-Learning)

[2.DQN](https://github.com/xuejieshougeji0826/Implementation-of-Morvan-Reinforcement-Learning-Teaching-in-Pytorch/tree/master/DQN)




The repsitory is stilling updating, I will try my best to finsih this work soon.
