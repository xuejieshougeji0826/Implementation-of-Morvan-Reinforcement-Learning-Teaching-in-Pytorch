This is a repository about the exercises of the Reinforcement Learning.  

It includes the main Reinforcement Learning algorithms which are based on the repository from Morvan's teaching github [Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow).  

The difference between his and mine is the framework, I used the Pytroch instead of Tensorflow to finish the same work, which means I refactor his work. I appreciate Movran's teaching, he is my mentoring teacher in Reinforcement Learning.  

The repsotory is stilling updating, I will try my best to finsih this work soon.
